# Ambedkar, Gandhi, and the Making of Postcolonial India #

## Introducing Ambedkar ##
**B.R. Ambedkar** (1891–1956) was an anti-caste activist, public intellectual, and one of the principal architects of the Indian Constitution. Born as a Dalit, or “untouchable,” Ambedkar was subject to casteist prejudices and oppressions throughout his formative years. Experiences include being made to sit on the classroom floor in lieu of a chair, and not being allowed to directly access water from drinking wells.[^first]

## Ambedkar's 1955 Interview ##

In this interview, Ambedkar – one year before his famous conversion to Buddhism and subsequent death – speaks with the interviewer, Francis Watson, about Gandhi. This is an important piece of oral history, particularly at a time when there is a wider historiographical and cultural re-evaluation of Gandhi and his legacy. This, we may consider, as a powerful starting point to a Dalit critique of Gandhi. Ambedkar largely notes herein the double-standards, or two-facedness, of Gandhi on the issue of caste.[^second]

As a piece of oral history, what I find compelling is not so much the accurary of Ambedkar's survey of Gandhi and Indian politics (e.g. in stating Gandhi was merely "an episode in the history of India") – but rather, the *relations of meaning* this world signified to Ambedkar at the twilight of his life. Ambedkar describes his three encounters with Gandhi in this interview: in 1929 vis. a common friend; in 1931 at the second round table conference, and in prison around the time of the Poona Pact. In the course of his survey of Gandhi's legacy, Ambedkar alludes a whole cosmology of Indian history.

## Ambedkar v. Gandhi ##

While struggling for independence against British colonialism, Ambedkar and Gandhi proffered two radically opposed accounts of caste in Indian society, and indeed, two radically different articulations of what a postcolonial Indian nation may be. The sustained debates and correspondences between Ambedkar and Gandhi vis. their respective journals are often how students of history are introduced to this ideological debate. However, this interview – recorded eight years after Gandhi’s assassination and one year before his own death – Ambedkar gives us something that exceeds the written text: an unmistakable tone of voice, a sharp diction that underscores the fact that this was not just a ideological disagreement, but also the irreconcilability of persons themselves. Certain tics and word choices (conspicuously, the “fangs” of Gandhi) indicate this. It gives hue to what many familiar with this debate suspect of the nature of their relationship – for Ambedkar, who lived through the violence of caste, found it personally offensive how the high-caste “Mahatma” patronized and side-lined the issue of caste in his nationalist forwarding of a harmonious, unified Indian society.

Gandhi, in his reformist newspaper *Harijan*, claimed that caste has nothing to with Hinduism – and if it did, he claimed provocatively, he would cease to live as a Hindu himself. Ambedkar, however, argued that caste is equivalent to Hinduism and as long as Hindu society exists, caste exists.[^third] The subtext is clear: the *annihilation of caste* (also the title of Ambedkar's most famous publication) means the annihilation – not necessarily of “Hinduism” – but the nationalist construct of an imagined entity called Hindu society. This is, in essence, the base of disagreement between Gandhi and Ambedkar. Ambedkar sought constitutional gurantees and policies of affirmative action to protect Dalits; Gandhi believed less in politics as a recourse for a solution, but religious, moral, and interpersonal reformism as an answer. In *Hind Swaraj*, Gandhi critiqued industrial states in the West and prescribed a model of decentralized village-societies run by a “trusteeship” of the village peers – this was what he envisioned as appropriate in the Indian context. Ambedkar refutes his idyllic vision of “trusteeship” as a barely veiled appeal for a casteist reordering of society; in effect, the Gandhian India is little more than the dreamscape of an upper-caste Hindu; it has no recourse, semblance of reality, or protection for minorities and lower-castes Indians. Lastly, both Gandhi and Ambedkar had different ideas about the Indian "collective" and it collectivity means. In a chapter of *Hind Swaraj* entitled "What is true civilization?," Gandhi describes an India binded by a "common people" and that "the tendency of Indian civilization is to elevate the moral being"[^fourth] of all its members. By contrast, Ambedkar proffers a less utopian account of Indian "Society." To speak of a "common people" is one of the foremost paradoxes of Indian nationalism; in his speech,"Looking to the Future," he poses the question: "What does fraternity [in a democratic triad with liberty and equality] mean?"[^fifth] How is can we think of "a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians – of Indians being one people"?[^sixth] Ambedkar's answer undercuts Gandhi's and radically recenters the question of caste as a problematic of nationalism: "in believing that we are a nation, we are cherishing a great delusion. **How can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation?**"[^seventh]
