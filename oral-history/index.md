B.R. Ambedkar (1891–1956) was an anti-caste activist, public intellectual, and one of the foremost architects of the Indian Constitution. Born as a Dalit, or “untouchable,” Ambedkar was subject to casteist prejudices and oppressions throughout his formative years. Experiences include being made to sit on the classroom floor in lieu of a chair, and not being allowed to directly access water from drinking wells. While struggling for independence against British colonialism, Ambedkar and Gandhi proffered two radically opposed accounts of caste in Indian society, and indeed, two radically different articulations of what a postcolonial Indian nation may be. The sustained debates and correspondences between Ambedkar and Gandhi vis. their respective journals are often how students of history are introduced to this ideological debate. However, this interview – recorded eight years after Gandhi’s assassination and one year before his own death – Ambedkar gives us something that exceeds the written text: an unmistakable tone of voice, a sharp diction that underscores the fact that this was not just a ideological disagreement, but also the irreconcilability of persons themselves. Certain tics and word choices (conspicuously, the “fangs” of Gandhi) indicate this. It gives hue to what many familiar with this debate suspect of the nature of their relationship – for Ambedkar, who lived through the violence of caste, found it personally offensive how the high-caste “Mahatma” patronized and side-lined the issue of caste in his nationalist forwarding of a harmonious, unified Indian society.

	Gandhi, in his reformist newspaper Harijan, claimed that caste has nothing to with Hinduism – and if it did, he claimed provocatively, he would cease to live as a Hindu himself. Ambedkar, however, argued that caste is equivalent to Hinduism and as long as Hindu society exists, caste exists. The subtext is clear: the annihilation of caste means the annihilation – not necessarily of “Hinduism” – but the nationalist construct of thing called Hindu society. This is, in essence, the base of disagreement between Gandhi and Ambedkar. Ambedkar sought constitutional gurantees and policies of affirmative action to protect Dalits; Gandhi believed less in politics as a recourse for a solution, but religious, moral, and interpersonal reformism as an answer. In Hind Swaraj, Gandhi critiqued industrial states in the West and prescribed a model of decentralized village-societies run by a “trusteeship” of the village peers – this was what he envisioned as appropriate in the Indian context. Ambedkar refutes his idyllic vision of “trusteeship” as a barely veiled appeal for a casteist reordering of society; in effect, the Gandhian India is little more than the dreamscape of an upper-caste Hindu; it has no recourse, semblance of reality, or protection for minorities and lower-castes Indians.


  - another use of embedded HTML is for funky javascript function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole linke in, as seen here: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, Remarkable supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:

    Footnote 1 link[^first].

    Footnote 2 link[^second].
