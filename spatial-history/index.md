# Preamble: Death in Mecca

At the outset of the twentieth-century, empires and local polities were scrambling to control Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage. In 1893, more than 30,000 people died from cholera in the Hijaz region alone. From 1899 to 1923, the “sixth pandemic” of cholera – contemporaneously referred to as “Asiatic cholera,” stretching from South Asia to North Africa – killed more than 34,000. In this state of emergency, Western (namely, British and French) medical scholarship conceptualized Mecca as a “relay station” for disease between East and West.

# Objective

To better understand this crisis and responses to it, I will consider how the Hajj became increasingly “medicalized” in this period – how conceptually, architecturally, politically – and indeed, spatially – one of the largest, international mass movements of human beings becomes the site of political-medical intervention, research, and quarantine.

I will consider and spatialize one of the many 19th-century “quarantine islands” in the Red Sea, namely, *Kamaran Island*. During the 1880s, these islands were transformed into quarantine camps (sometimes referred to as lazarets/lazarettos) for Asian and African pilgrims. The construction, spatial emplacement, and pilgrim experiences vis-à-vis these quarantine camps may offer us a window in to the techniques used to medicalize Hajj and how it impacted international pilgrims.

# Kamaran as Qurantine Island, 1882-1952

Instituted in 1882 by the Ottoman Health Board, partly in reaction/in anxiety to French, British, and other colonial interventions premised on “disease control,” the island of Kamaran – off the coast of Yemen, a virtually uninhabited space save for five significant fishing villages on the eastern coast – is transformed into a mandatory quarantine camp. A few primary sources say pilgrims stay there for five days, however, most say ten days and some even fifteen days. Pilgrims live in straw huts called _arishes_; common critiques were levelled against housing conditions and an ironic lack of medical facilities in these camps. After 1914, the British take over Kamaran Qurantine Station (as it is now officially named) and continue running it until 1952, after the relocation of quarantine facilities to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

# Spatializing Kamaran: Sources

Even though it ran continuously for 70 years, there are few maps or conclusive spatial accounts as to where these camps are (now, likely dissembled) on the island; indeed, there is no GIS information/markers available for this island viz. Google Maps. For this spatial history of Kamaran (and other relevant spaces in the history of Hajj medicalization), I rely on the following sources:
-	A 1896 map (“Plan de l’ile de Camaran”) from “Rapport de la Commission des Lazarets Présenté Au Conseil Supérieur de Santé le 23/24 Août 1896” (in Tagliacozzo, _The Longest Journey_, p. 136) – [view here.](blob:https://imgur.com/b1c80e5c-c4a0-4564-a8da-8de40b7dff1c)
-	[A 1957 survey map (“Kamaran Island”) from the British “War Office and Air Ministry”](http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-233246749/view)

Markers refer to important sites on the island; the red overlay is an estimate of the 1896 section on the general "partie réservée pour les quarantenaires."

# Spatializing Kamaran: Notes

There are several ways of thinking about this space. On one level, as positioned here, is the island itself. The island itself, a unit of space, paradoxically both isolated by water and connected vis-a-vis a common Red Sea and Indian Ocean world system. In addition to thinking of Kamaran as a self-enclosed unit, it is also connected to the world in different sense: as a kind of medial, liminal stage between a point of departure and the port to Jeddah. At once, the dual spatial qualities of isolation and connectedness proffered by "the island" is used as the administrative site of quarantine.

In this sense, we are reminded of a common way French, British and American sources phrase Kamaran's facilities: as _lazaret_ or _lazaretto_. It is an Italian word that comes from the Biblical story of "Lazarus," and etymologically, connotes both "isolation" and "hospital"; herein, the almost contradictory spatial intentions _to isolate_ and enclose, while at the same time, _to take care of_, an implication of a medicalized relationship, are expressed in a single word. It is a word that comes into prominence at the outset of plague in Malta; lazaretto is, again and again, used as a synonym for "leper colony," "isolation ward," and as in the case of Kamaran, as "quarantine."

In Foucault's _Discipline and Punish_, namely his famous essay "Panopticism," we see him treat outbreaks of plague, quarantine procedure, and states of emergency as moments that reveal the "political dream[s]" beheld by local polities; they express to the historian the ways power is imagined in a time and space, its exertion and function, its myths and limitations. In the example given of a village plague crisis in the 16th century, the local government tried to create a space that was "segmented, immobile, frozen" (p. 195) – a space held inline, a space that tried to prevent the spread of disease by curfew, ceaseless inspection, and an omniprescent gaze (or in other words, surveillence). What I would like to draw from this is the tacit claim that space – the way it is arranged and transformed – is a way in which power is manifested, held, and made. Indeed, the very idea of the panopticon described later is simply an architectural and spatial structure that creates a power relationship.

Taking this cue from Foucault, we can pose the following, general question: how then read the Kamaran Quarantine Station and its position in an island as a power situation? The island as a power relation: who is able to move in it, who is able to traverse, enter, exit, et al? The lack of cartographic and accessible public information on Kamaran itself warrants the suspiscion that this is itself a manifestation of power: a way of containing one to a familiar quarter.

In addition to thinking about the quarter/quarantine space, the island space, the oceanic space, and the medial-Hajj space, we can also think about the imaginative geography implied by Mecca as a "relay station" between "East and West." Underscored by David Arnold in _Colonizing the Body_,  "Asiatic cholera" and  international anxieties about it enabled the a vision of space – from tropical, underdeveloped plaguelands to temperate, civilized urban centres. Kamaran as a counter-station to this teleogy of disease from East to West (sometimes expressed as a kind of Hegelian movement from East to West, sometimes oriented spaces from East to West in concentric circles) is another kind of spatial imagination expressed herein.
