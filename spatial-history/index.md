# Preamble: Death in Mecca

At the outset of the twentieth-century, empires and local polities were scrambling to control Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage. In 1893, more than 30,000 people died from cholera in the Hijaz region alone (Goodman 1971). From 1899 to 1923, the “sixth pandemic” of cholera – contemporaneously referred to as “Asiatic cholera,” stretching from South Asia to North Africa – killed more than 34,000. In this state of emergency, Western (namely, British and French) medical scholarship conceptualized Mecca as a “relay station” for disease between East and West (Peters 1994).

# Objective

To better understand this crisis and responses to it, I will consider how the Hajj became increasingly “medicalized” in this period – how conceptually, architecturally, politically – and indeed, spatially – one of the largest, international mass movements of human beings becomes the site of political-medical intervention, research, and quarantine.

I will consider and spatialize one of the many 19th-century “quarantine islands” in the Red Sea, namely, *Kamaran Island*. During the 1880s, these islands were transformed into quarantine camps (sometimes referred to as lazarets/lazarettos) for Asian and African pilgrims. The construction, spatial emplacement, and pilgrim experiences vis-à-vis these quarantine camps may offer us a window in to the techniques used to medicalize Hajj and how it impacted international pilgrims.

# Kamaran as Qurantine Island, 1882-1952

Instituted in 1882 by the Ottoman Health Board, partly in reaction/in anxiety to French, British, and other colonial interventions premised on “disease control,” the island of Kamaran – off the coast of Yemen, a virtually uninhabited space save for five significant fishing villages on the eastern coast – is transformed into a mandatory quarantine camp. A few primary sources say pilgrims stay there for five days, however, most say ten days and some even fifteen days. Pilgrims live in straw huts called _arishes_; common critiques were levelled against housing conditions and an ironic lack of medical facilities in these camps. After 1914, the British take over Kamaran Qurantine Station (as it is now officially named) and continue running it until 1952, after the relocation of quarantine facilities to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

# Spatializing Kamaran

Even though it ran continuously for 70 years, there are few maps or conclusive spatial accounts as to where these camps are (now, likely dissembled) on the island; indeed, there is no GIS information/markers available for this island viz. Google Maps. For this spatial history of Kamaran (and other relevant spaces in the history of Hajj medicalization), I rely on the following sources:
-	A 1896 map (“Plan de l’ile de Camaran”) from “Rapport de la Commission des Lazarets Présenté Au Conseil Supérieur de Santé le 23/24 Août 1896” (in Tagliacozzo, _The Longest Journey_, p. 136)
-	A 1957 survey map (“Kamaran Island”) from the British “War Office and Air Ministry”
